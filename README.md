In this repository, we document the processes of the AI Validation Team at the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom
Relations (Min BZK) in The Netherlands.

This repository is deployed here: [https://minbzk.github.io/ai-validation/](https://minbzk.github.io/ai-validation/)

The AI Validation team is no longer active. We operated from from August 2023 through March 2025. This documentation is
no longer maintained and is only available for historical purposes.
