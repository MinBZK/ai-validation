# Holistic AI

See the [introduction](../comparison/tools.md#holistic-ai). It is a toolkit just like IBM-360-Toolkit for a
data scientist to research bias and also to mitigate it immediately.

| The tool allows users to conduct technical tests on algorithms or models, including assessments of performance, bias, and fairness. To facilitate these tests, users can input relevant datasets, | M        | 1         | The tests which can be executed are written in the [Holistic AI documentation](https://holistic-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html)                                                                                                            |
| The tool allows users to choose which tests to perform.                                                                                                                                           | M        | 1         | In code the user is free to choose any test                                                                                                                                                                                |
| The tool allows users to fill out questionnaires to conduct impact assessments for AI. For example IAMA or ALTAI.                                                                                 | M        | 0         | The tool only does technical tests                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| The tool can generate a human readable report.                                                                                                                                                    | M        | 0         | The toolkit itself cannot make a human readable report, it only generates results which then needs to be interpreted                                                                                                       |
| The tools works with a standardized report format, that it can read, write, and update.                                                                                                           | M        | 0         | The only format it outputs are specific numbers, so no standardized format or even een report format                                                                                                                       |
| The tool supports plugin functionality so additional tests can be added easily.                                                                                                                   | S        | 0         | All the bias tests are put in a [single script](https://github.com/holistic-ai/holisticai/blob/main/holisticai/bias/metrics/_classification.py) which making additional tests a bit cumbersome and leas developer-friendly |
| The tool allows to create custom reports based on components.                                                                                                                                     | S        | 0         | Does not allow reports export                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| It is possible to add custom components for reports.                                                                                                                                              | S        | 0         | Does not allow reports export                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The tool provides detailed logging, including tracking of different model versions, changes in impact assessments, and technical test results for individual runs.                                | S        | 0         | Not ouf of the box, but this could be written in code by the owner of the algorithm                                                                                                                                        |
