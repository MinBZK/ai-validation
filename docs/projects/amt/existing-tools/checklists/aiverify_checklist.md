| The tool allows users to conduct technical tests on algorithms or models, including assessments of performance, bias, and fairness. To facilitate these tests, users can input relevant datasets, | M         | 1         | This is core functionality of AIVerify                                                                                                                                                  |
| The tool allows users to choose which tests to perform.                                                                                                                                           | M         | 1         | This is core functionality of AIVerify                                                                                                                                                  |
| The tool allows users to fill out questionnaires to conduct impact assessments for AI. For example IAMA or ALTAI.                                                                                 | M         | 1         | This is core functionality of AIVerify, however work is needed to add extra impact assessments                                                                                          |
| The tool can generate a human readable report.                                                                                                                                                    | M         | 1         | This is core functionality of AIVerify                                                                                                                                                  |
| The tools works with a standardized report format, that it can read, write, and update.                                                                                                           | M         | 0         | The outputted format is a [PDF format](https://imda-btg.github.io/aiverify/user-interface-features/report-generating-page/), so this cannot be updated, or easily read by a machine.    |
| The tool supports plugin functionality so additional tests can be added easily.                                                                                                                   | S         | 0.5       | One can add a test as a [plugin](https://imda-btg.github.io/aiverify-developer-tools/plugins/), it can however be a bit too technical still for many people.                            |
| The tool allows to create custom reports based on components.                                                                                                                                     | S         | 1         | One can slide the technical tests results and the assessment test results into a report which will be placed into a PDF                                                                 |
| It is possible to add custom components for reports.                                                                                                                                              | S         | 1         | It is possible, but just like with tests can be hard for non-technical people                                                                                                           |
| The tool provides detailed logging, including tracking of different model versions, changes in impact assessments, and technical test results for individual runs.                                | S         | 0.5       | There are versions of models when uploaded, and the report itself is the technical test result of a run. Changes to impact assessments are not logged (only when a report is generated) |
| The tool supports saving progress.                                                                                                                                                                | S         | 1         | Reports can be saved, while it is being constructed                                                                                                                                     |
| The tool can be used on an isolated system without an internet connection.                                                                                                                        | S         | 1         | Locally the docker container can be build and ran                                                                                                                                       |
| The tool offers options to discuss and document conversations. For example, to converse about technical tests or to collaborate on impact assessments.                                            | C         | 0         | Only the end-result will be logged into the report                                                                                                                                      |
| The tool operates with complete data privacy; it does not share any data or logging information.                                                                                                  | C         | 1         | The application is a docker application and does not do this                                                                                                                            |
| The tool allows extension of report formats functionality.                                                                                                                                        | C         | 1         | We could program this functionality in the tool and submit a PR                                                                                                                         |
| The tool can be integrated in a CI/CD flow.                                                                                                                                                       | C         | 0.5       | It is possible, but would be very heavy to do so. The build time is quite large, and only the technical tests could be ran in an automated fashion                                      |
| The tool can be offered as a (cloud) service where no local installation is required.                                                                                                             | C         | 0         | AIVerify is currently not doing this, we could however offer it as a cloud service                                                                                                      |
| It is possible to define and automate workflows for repetitive tasks.                                                                                                                             | C         | 0         | As this tool is focused on UI, this is not possible                                                                                                                                     |
| The tool offers pre-built connectors or low-code/no-code integration options to simplify the integration process.                                                                                 | C         | 0         | This is not included                                                                                                                                                                    |

| The tool operates consistently and reliably, meaning it delivers the same expected results every time you use it.                      | M        | 1         | The tool did not break down a single time while we were coding a plugin (only threw errors)                                                                                                                              |
| The tool recovers automatically from common failures.                                                                                  | S        | 1         | Common failures like missing datasets or models are not breaking                                                                                                                                                         |
| The tool recovers from failures quickly, minimizing data loss, for example by automatically saving intermediate test progress results. | S        | 0.5       | The assessments you need to manually save otherwise it will be lost, but over different sessions the data will be stored persistent even if the containers go down. Test results are only stored in the generated report |
| The tool handles errors gracefully and informs users of any issues.                                                                    | S        | 1         | When failed to generate a report the tool will log the error messages, otherwise when loading in data that is non existing the application (while not being very clear in error message) just continues with an error    |
| The tool provides clear error messages and instructions for troubleshooting.                                                           | S        | 0.5       | The test-engine-core is a dependency that is installed as a package, and therefore the error message will not contain error in that package                                                                              |
