# VerifyML

See the [introduction](../comparison/tools.md#verifyml), the maker also suggests
to use an front-end tool to collaboratively change the model card.
[Model Card Editor](https://report.verifyml.com/) this is not
open-source and also the developer suggests in this
[issue](https://github.com/cylynx/verifyml/issues/63) to not
use this tool but to use tools like AIVerify. This checklist
only looks at the verifyML python toolkit and not the web interface.
