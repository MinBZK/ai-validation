# AMT

AMT is the acronym for [Algorithm Management Toolkit](https://amt.prd.apps.digilab.network).
The AMT aims to enhance transparency and governance throughout
the entire lifecycle of algorithmic systems. By generating standardized reports, AMT provides a comprehensive view
of both technical details and descriptive information, including regulatory assessments, from development to deployment
and beyond. This continuous approach promotes accountability, oversight, and collaboration, ensuring that both models
and data remain transparent, controlled, and validated over time. The definition for an algorithm is derived from the
[Algoritmeregister](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/nl/footer/over-algoritmes).

One of the goals of the AMT is providing a standardized format of reporting on an algorithmic
system by developing a [Reporting Standard](reporting-standard/index.md). This Reporting Standard consists out of a
[System Card](reporting-standard/index.md#system_card) which contains
[Model Cards](reporting-standard/index.md#model_card) and
[Assessment Cards](reporting-standard/index.md#assessment_card).

The final result of the AMT is producing System, Model and Assessment Cards with performance metrics, (regulatory)
assessments on the system where the specific algorithm resides, and descriptive information about the system.

The requirements and instruments are dictated by the [Algoritmekader](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/).
