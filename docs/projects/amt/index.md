# Algorithm Management Toolkit (AMT)

The [Algorithm Management Toolkit (AMT)](https://github.com/MinBZK/amt) aims to enhance transparency and
governance throughout the entire lifecycle of algorithmic systems. By generating standardized reports, AMT provides a
comprehensive view of both technical details and descriptive information, including regulatory assessments, from
development to deployment and beyond. This continuous approach promotes accountability, oversight, and collaboration,
ensuring that both models and data remain transparent, controlled, and validated over time. The definition for an
algorithm is derived from the [Algoritmeregister](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/nl/footer/over-algoritmes).

The requirements and instruments are dictated by the [Algoritmekader](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/). The
[Algorithm Reporting Standard](../algorithm-reporting-standard/index.md) is used to store the information in a
structured way. The final result of the AMT is kind of a book keeping platform for algorithms. A platform where you can
keep track of System, Model and Assessment Cards with performance metrics, (regulatory) assessments on the system where
the specific algorithm resides, and descriptive  information about the system.
